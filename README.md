# Pixterest
Pixterest is the industry-leading Pinterest clone, designed specifically for pixel art.


Pixterest uses DeviantArt's RSS API to fetch your favourite images and save them for you to use later - try searching for an image, or
looking through the explore page to find inspiration.


This site, built with MERN and docker, is designed to be fully responsive and usable at every screen size, minus extreme aspect ratios. Sign up/in to save posts - no email is required.
If you spot anything that needs fixing, please let me know :).
